In C++, a constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. Constructors are primarily used to initialize the object's data members and allocate resources if necessary.
Key Points about Constructors:

    1.Same Name as Class: A constructor has the same name as the class in which it is declared.
    2. No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.
    3. Automatically Called: Constructors are automatically called when an object of the class  is instantiated.
    4. Can Be Overloaded: You can define multiple constructors with different parameters (constructor overloading).

Types of Constructors:

    1. Default Constructor: A constructor that takes no arguments. If no constructors are explicitly defined, the compiler provides a default constructor.
    2. Parameterized Constructor: A constructor that takes one or more parameters to initialize the object with specific values.
    3. Copy Constructor: A constructor that initializes an object using another object of the same class.
    4. Destructor: Although not a constructor, itâ€™s important to mention that destructors are special functions that are called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
